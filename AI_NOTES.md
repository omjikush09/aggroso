## How AI Was Used

### 🖥 IDE Integration

- AI was used directly within the IDE (VS Code) via integrated AI coding assistants.
- Assisted with real-time code suggestions, inline completions, and code reviews.
- Helped with component design, TypeScript type definitions, and Prisma schema modeling.

### 💻 CLI Usage

- AI was invoked via the command line for more complex tasks like:
  - Scaffolding project structure
  - Writing Prisma schemas and migrations
  - Generating boilerplate code for Express routes, controllers, and services
  - Debugging runtime errors and type mismatches
  - Setting up Docker Compose configurations
