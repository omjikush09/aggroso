# 📝 Prompts Used

These are the prompts used with AI tools (Claude Opus 4.6 & Codex 5.3) to build **SpecGen (Aggroso)**.

---

- "Set up a pnpm monorepo with a client (React + Vite) and server (Express) workspace. Configure pnpm-workspace.yaml and root package.json with a dev script that runs both in parallel."

- "Add a docker-compose.yml with a PostgreSQL 17 container. Include environment variables for user, password, and database name. Add a health check and persistent volume."

- "Use Express 5 for the backend with TypeScript, cors, and body-parser. Set up Nodemon for hot reload in development."

- "Use Vite with React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4 for the frontend. Add @tailwindcss/vite plugin."

- "Use Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL. Design a schema with ProjectSpec, Story, and Task models. Use composite keys, ordering by position, and cascade delete."

- "Use Zod for request validation. Create schemas for generate and update endpoints and build a reusable validation middleware."

- "Use @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop task reordering instead of react-beautiful-dnd."

- "Use shadcn/ui for reusable UI components like Button, Input, and Select."


- "Write a service function that takes goal, users, constraints, and template as input, generates structured user stories and engineering tasks, and stores results in the database using Prisma."

- "Implement a health check endpoint that returns backend uptime, database connectivity status, and response time in milliseconds."

- "Integrate TypeScript into both client and server. Set up tsconfig.json for both, migrate JS files to TS, and use Nodemon for the server."
